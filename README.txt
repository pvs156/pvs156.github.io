-- First Draft  --

I built this portfolio website by customizing an open-source HTML5 UP template. The template uses modern web technologies like:
-CSS/SCSS
-HTML
-JavaScript
It features a responsive and adaptable design that automatically adjusts for optimal viewing across different screen sizes.

By leveraging this pre-made template, I was able to get my portfolio online to showcase my work and skills. Moving forward, I plan to customize it further based on feedback I would receive.
